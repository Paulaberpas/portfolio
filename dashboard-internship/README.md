Web developer internship at Active Cues
February - June 2019, Utrecht

Active Cues creates interactive tables (Tovertafel) for people with dementia, intellectual disabilities, and people with autism.

During my internship, I developed the new analytics dashboard inside their device management portal. The dashboard extracts and visualizes essential business data, gathered from units all over the world. The visualisations of the data are used daily by everyone in the company. Besides the dashboard, I had a chance to work closely with a UX/UI designer. Together we updated the appearance of the entire portal.

Gained skills:
• making asynchronous API-calls
• structuring code according to MVC principles
• implementing pixel perfect designs
• combining new libraries and plugins with existing code


All relevant information has being changed/blurry to protect the data privacy of the company and their clients.
