Week 8. Mobile Prototyping (UI/UX) in InvisionApp

GreenDinner app

Project lead: Paula Bernal Pastor

Description: GreenDinner randomly gives you seven healthy vegetarian recipes that will be ready in less than 40 minutes.

The app tries to solve the problem of not being able to find the time to look for varied healthy vegetarian recipes every week. 

Save time, get your weekly dinners planned in less than a minute. Other apps are created for people that want to look for the perfect recipe, this app suggest the perfect recipe for you.

Get your grocery list.

Eat more healthy. Many apps have all kinds of recipes in their database, and you have to search through a lot of unhealthy options until you find something suitable. This makes you more likely to choose something unhealthy.

The app offers the possibility to choose between a vegetarian or vegan diet aswell as avoid some ingredients that can cause allergies.

If you don't like a recipe you can change it for any other recipe in the database. You can save your favorite recipes for quick access.


Existing apps:

- Mealime: This app gives a huge amount of options, so getting started is a slow and tedious process. 
You have to choose the recipes yourself.
The app continuously suggests you to upgrade to a payed plan.
This is a good app for someone with a lot of time and is not so worried about following a healthy diet.

- Foodplanner: With this app you have to browse the web for recipes and download them into the app, which makes the process even slower than with the previous app.
This app uses very strong colors (red and black), it looks very busy, displays adds continuosly and doesn't give the user a calm and healthy sensation. 
On the other hand, it does give you nutricional data.

- Yummly: Visualy very appealing, with beautiful photographs of the dishes.
It gives you all kinds of recipes (breakfast, dinner, lunch, dessert..) and you have to search for the one you want, so again a tedious process.
